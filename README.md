# bamazon

This is a CLI app that will prompt the user to enter ID for items they want to purchace.  Once the user enters the item and the quantity they want the Database will update to reflect the new quantity and will also show on the terminal screen.

I used a node package called CLI-Tables to display the data in a nice grid to make for easy viewing and a better UX
Node packages MySQL and Inquirer were also used in the app.


first the user will need to select a product they want to buy.  Enter the item number for the product
![select product you want to buy](https://github.com/mpneuman/bamazon/blob/master/images/bamazon_1.png)

This info comes from the MySQL Database

)
Next enter the quantity you would like to purchace and the quantity will update the MYSQL DATABASE
![quantity selected](https://github.com/mpneuman/bamazon/blob/master/images/bamazon3.png)

The screen will now show the updated quantity on hand
![update quantity](https://github.com/mpneuman/bamazon/blob/master/images/bamazon4.png)

DataBase has now been pdated to the new quantity on hand)
